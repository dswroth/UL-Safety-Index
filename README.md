Data and Methodology of the UL Safety Index

The UL Safety Index is an algorithm-based, data science initiative that provides individuals and organizations relevant data they may use to explore safety, inform policy and investment choices and make science-based decisions for a more secure, healthier and safer world.  
 
 The UL Safety Index algorithm uses data from trustworthy organizations in the fields of economics, human development, governance, public health, and safety.  The algorithm normalizes data from these diverse sources and combines thousands of data points into 16 indicators and 3 drivers; ultimately producing the UL Safety Index.  The Index, Drivers and Indicators are values between 0 and 100, higher being better.  The current version of the UL Safety Index is focused on unintentional injury.

Each of the data sources in the safety index is normalized using a simple technique that sets the low and high values at 0 and 100 respectively, and then distributing the remaining points proportionally between the minimum and maximum values.  These sixteen indicators are combined into drivers using an arithmetic mean, in order to fairly account for the fact that data is not available for all indicators in all countries.  

The three drivers â€“ Institutions & Resources, Safety Frameworks and Safety Outcomes - are combined into the UL Safety Index through the calculation of the geometric mean.  Use of the geometric mean accounts for the fact that the three drivers are not perfect substitutes for each other.

(The Safety Outcomes Indicators are the nine classifications of unintentional injury from the World Health Organization.  They are: 
Transport Injuries
Drowning
Exposure to fires, heat and hot substances
Poisoning
Falls
Exposure to foreign bodies  (choking, for example)
Exposure to mechanical forces
Exposure to the forces of nature and disasters
